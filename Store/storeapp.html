					<header>Be Scandalized by a Young Autistic Woman's Take on this Ancient Poem about Sex and Relationship!</header>
				</section> 
				<div id="Give">
					<p>The natural candor from her high functioning autism gives her a unique perspective on life.  It was this very quality that drew him to her.  But, when she freely begins sharing her unadulterated views on sexual pleasure and everything beautiful in a sensual relationship, his religious background screams at him to run for the hills!  Even more so when she tells him she got her perspective from the Bible!</p>
					<br />
					<p> Can Solomon's ancient love poem change his mind and break their relationship free from the constraints of the societal and religious thinking which have warped love in America for so long?  He'll have to face old wounds and long held fears on the way to the healing and joy they both need.</p>

						<p id="songeight">	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.
						Who is that coming up from the wilderness,
						leaning on her beloved?
						Under the apple tree I awakened you.
						There your mother was in labor with you;
						there she who bore you was in labor.</p>
						
						<p>Set me as a seal upon your heart,
						as a seal upon your arm,
						for love is strong as death,
						jealousy is fierce as the grave.
						Its flashes are flashes of fire,
						the very flame of the LORD.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Many waters cannot quench love,
						neither can floods drown it.
						If a man offered for love
						all the wealth of his house,
						he would be utterly despised.</p>
						<br />
						<header>Others</header> 
						<p>We have a little sister,
						and she has no breasts.
						What shall we do for our sister
						on the day when she is spoken for?</p> 
						<p>If she is a wall,
						we will build on her a battlement of silver,
						but if she is a door,
						we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</p>
						<br />
						<header>She</header>
						<p>I was a wall,
						and my breasts were like towers;
						then I was in his eyes
						as one who finds[fn] peace.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
						he let out the vineyard to keepers;
						each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
						My vineyard, my very own, is before me;
						you, O Solomon, may have the thousand,
						and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.</p>
						<br />
						<header>He</header>
						<p>O you who dwell in the gardens,
						with companions listening for your voice;
						let me hear it.</p>
