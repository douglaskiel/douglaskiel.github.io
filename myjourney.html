                    <p>Music is the language that everybody knows, and yet everybody wouldn't think of as a language.  I have studied music from my earliest time in school.  I was in choir from the youngest age, and when given the chance to pick up an instrument I through a little persuasion picked the Saxophone of which I majored for a year and a half.  I have never been the greatest, but my love of music was solidified from the beginning.  I have trained myself in audio-engineering.  Music being such an important part of everyone's life.  I believe it is most necessary and crucial to all learning experience, no matter if it is for coding or writing a paper.  That's why I think this is important to my understanding code.</p>

                    <p class=>Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?  This is the first line in one of Marcus Tulius Cicero's, a very pristigious statesman of Rome, most famous oratories.  It says, "How long will you abuse our patience, Catiline."  Latin was my first look and experience in language and made me the logical person I am today.  From Latin, I have learned French, Greek, Korean, some Japanese, and a little Spanish.  Now I can add JavaScript to that list of languages that I have learned.</p>

The third one that I stand on as very important to cultural distinction is that countries religion.  I do not stand to make one better than the others, although I do hold fast to one.  As I have studied religion in university, I have found that religion is extremely important to a cultures society.  I would not be where I am without my faith and trust in Him. </p>

                    <p>I only learned about this two years ago, and I'm not officially diagnosed, but have seen truths in books of other autistic persons books that confirmed it in my mind, and from my counselors suggestion.  The understanding of logic, focused interests and boredom of things that don't interest me have been tale tell signs.  Although, I have moved beyond all of this with the help of good friends, loved ones and my faith.  The logic and focus of autism are the aspects that will make me very successful in life and in the coding industry.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As big and special as the Earth is, size is fairly relative in today's age where technology takes us everywhere at the push of a button. The beauty of the human race and all the accomplishments that the human mind is capable of is astounding.  We are still small in this great place to live, but easing the way we work and live is a constant striving within the human psyche.</p>

                    <p>I stand in a place where I can do anything to which I put my mind. Coding is an opportunity for me to show how I can make the things I think understood and give others paths to follow as we all work together.</p>
